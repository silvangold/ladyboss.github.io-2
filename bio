  <p>Laura is a doctoral candidate in the department of English. She studies literary modernism, and is especially interested in why contemporary writers believe that it's a good idea to compare themselves to James Joyce.</p>
  <p> (It's not usually a good idea)</p>
  <p> I am very much looking forward to my year as a CHI Fellow. I am looking forward to launching a large-scale, text analysis project on the Armed Services Editions. The Armed Services Editions are a collection of ~1,500 novels, repurposed for American soldiers during WWII. These texts were collected by the Council on Books in Wartime, a short-lived (and scary-sounding) office in the Department of Defense. The idea, so the CBW’s story goes, was to select only the most “democratic” novels in order to help American soldiers “fight the war of ideas.” Through a literary-sociological corpus study, I want to figure out what a “democratic” novel or style is– at least, according to the Department of Defense in 1942. This project has the potential to open up some fascinating questions about the intersection of politics and literary form, and hopefully give some insight on the literary field during a crucial period in American culture.</p>
